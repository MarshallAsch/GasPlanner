## No decompression limits

Use the same options like when planning normal dive. The shown No decompression limits (NDL) table represents for each depth maximum bottom time (including descent) after which diver reaches no decompression limit.
The table shows only depths between 12 - 42 m (40 - 130 ft), because below these depths no decompression limits are hard to reach or the dive becomes saturation dive. Maximum depth is limited by the oxygen percents and maximum partial pressure (ppO2) content as they define the maximum operational depth for selected gas mixture. Eg. for Ean32 and 1.4 ppO2 the maximum operational depth is 33 m (110 ft). And that is why the table does not show higher depths for this settings.

## Altitude

The altitude diving calculator helps to estimate altitude from the current air pressure and based on the provided actual depth helps to estimate current depth. Eg. you are going to dive at altitude 300 m (100 ft) to 20 meters and you are going to use air tables for dives at sea level. So you can the use Theoretical sea level depth as adjusted target depth for your planned dive.

## Weight

The weight calculator helps to estimate required additional lead the diver needs to use to compensate weight lost during the dive as gas from provided tank is consumed. This does not count with protection suit weight compensation using additional lead. E.g. if you consume 150 b (2175 psi) from 15 L (125 cuft) tank, you will need to add 2.8 kg (6.1 lb) of lead to be neutrally buoyant. This calculator is based on assumption that 1 liter of dry air at 15 Â°C weights 1,225 g.

## Gas properties

This calculator uses simple depth converter where 1 ATM equals 1 bar to simplify the results understanding. This calculator extends properties shown by Nitrox calculator. By adding helium to gas mixture (trimix) you are able to choose gas for higher depths range and more properties come to account. It helps to understand gas properties under higher pressure at depth. The key understandings are:

* Don't breath gas with higher density than 5.7 g/l. see also <https://gue.com/blog/density-discords-understanding-and-applying-gas-density-research/> and <https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-calculate-density-of-a-gas-607847>
* Stay within limit of maximum narcotic depth (`MND`), maximum depth (`MOD`) and minimum depth.
* Equivalent narcotic depth (`END`) is affected by both nitrox and oxygen depending on your understanding if oxygen is narcotic or not.
* Maximum partial pressure limits maximum depth by oxygen content.

The results shown in the table respect all options defined in this form. More details about all of the are described in Nitrox calculator chapter or in [events](./events.md).
