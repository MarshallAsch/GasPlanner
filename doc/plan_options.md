# Plan options

* [Environment](./environment.md)
* [Conservatism](./gradient_factors.md)
* [Gases](./plan_options.md#gases)
* [Stops](./stops.md)
* [Speeds](./speeds.md)
* [Diver](./plan_options.md#diver)

For faster customization or to be able reset options to default values, you can use two buttons.

* `Recreational`: Options taught in basic open water courses for most training agencies. This will switch e.g. safety stop to 5 meters (15 ft) and ascent speeds to 9 meters/minute (30 ft/min).
* `Recommended`: We strongly encourage you to use these values instead of recreational values, because we thing they are safer and they are the default values for this application. This sets e.g. slower ascent closer to surface.

> To be able to see and edit all mentioned dive options you need to switch to Extended (Trimix) view. 

## Gases

* `Maximum narcotic depth` [m]: Limits, at which depth gas mixture is considered to be narcotic. Exceeding this depth means the risk of narcosis significantly increases. Default value is 30 meters (100 ft). Increasing this values allows you to use also nitrox mixes to higher depth, which is not recommended.
* `Is oxygen narcotic`: If enabled (default), counts also oxygen as narcotic gas, otherwise only nitrogen is considered to be narcotic. Most agencies count both oxygen and nitrogen as narcotic gases. Disabling this option allows to you to use gases deeper, but is less safer.

## Diver

These are the same settings you can find in [application settings](./settings.md#edit), but here mentioned options apply only to current dive. This allows you distinguish dives more demanding your condition.
