# Dive profile chart

Graphical representation how the calculated depth changes in time. This corresponds to precise values shown in the way points table. Move mouse over the chart to focus related row in the waypoints table.

* `Dive profile`: Blue line showing diver depth at each moment during the dive.
* `Ceiling`: Orange line showing minimum depth at which diver needs to stay to decompress before he continues with ascent.
* `Average depth`: Dotted line showing average depth at each moment of the dive. This is useful for consumption calculations.

Why is deco shown in the chart, if profile is still considered a no deco?
In some plans you already reach small amount of ceiling, which disappears during the ascent even without any decompression stop. So you are still free to ascent directly to the surface. These kind of dives are still considered as no decompression.

> In the chart profile, the blue line should never cross the orange line!
