# Depth(s)

![Target depth](./target_depth_properties.png)

* `Bottom time` [minutes]: The time diver stays under water until he starts to scent. This includes also decent.
    * `Max`: Applies the maximum estimated bottom time to the plan
    * `No deco`: Applies the maximum no decompression limit time to the plan
* `Depth` [meters] (ft): The deepest depth reached during the dive.
    * `Max`: Based on selected options applies maxim depth based on narcotic depth selected gas (for nitrox mixes always 30 meters / 100 ft)
    * `Best mix`: Shows best content of nitrox mix for selected depth based on maximum partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2)



* TODO behavior of multiple depths
